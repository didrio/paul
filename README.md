# Paul.js

Paul.js is an abstraction library built on top of the Web Audio API's oscillator and filter features. It's intended to simplify the API and make it easier to work with, especially for people with more of a musical background. 

```js
  const osc = new Osc('C', 'triangle', 5);
  osc.play();
```
